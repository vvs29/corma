App.js - Take the bank transaction file as input and sends it to a server which hosts the corma repo

a new file reader calls transaction identifier to add memberIDs (in future, ML logic to tag unidentified transactions) - this is the response back to App.js

Now each entry here is the inputString and calls Classifier.js (which internally calls the server again to get list of members) - [? when we change page will it again retrieve member list]

when we create a member, call the server to save it in DB and rerender to fetch list of members again from the server

On clicking the Done button in classifier.js show a summary of all transactions

on clicking the continue button send the info to server

in the server, run transaction processor to compute contribution info and then run exporter to send back the report
